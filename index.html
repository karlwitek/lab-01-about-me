      <h1>About Me:     Karl Witek</h1>
        <p class="medium-text">I am currently studying to become a software developer.  Before attending Alchemy Code Lab, I did some self-study
      and started to learn Python.  I have lived in Oregon for most of my life.  I think Oregon is a great place to live.
      In my free time, I like to play golf with friends, hike some trails or take a road trip and explore Oregon.
      My past jobs include golf professional and painting contractor.</p>

        <p class="medium-text">As a golf professional, I gave golf lessons, organized tournaments, managed other
        employees and worked in the golf shop.  I helped players of all ages with
        swing, short game and course management.  During my career, I played in over 20 local tournaments against professionals from Oregon 
        and Washington.  After 11 years, I decided to make a change and started a business as a painting contractor for the second time.
        I still enjoy playing golf.  I have a lot friends from those days and is something I like to do with my Father.  We have 
        played some great courses together.  We have gone on trips to Pebble Beach and Scotland, to play where the game was invented.</p>

        <p class="medium-text">Most of the hikes are embark on these days are day hikes.  Most of them have been a couple hours from 
            Portland or closer.  Heading out to the gorge, the coast or Mt. Hood usually equals a day well spent.  I have backpacked
            for multiple days and I hope to get back into it.  I tagged along with a friend who hiked the PCT for a month.  I wish I could 
            have hiked longer but I wasn't set up financially to abandon real life for six months.
